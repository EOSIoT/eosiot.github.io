## Welcome to the EOSIoT main site

Here you will find links to various IoT and blockchain projects we are working on.

- EOSIoT is now Measurement Earth [https://www.measurement.earth](https://www.measurement.earth).
- RFID scanner for Raspberry Pi's active [website](https://eosiot.github.io/rfid-html/).


### News
- `08/20/2021` It's here! After months of testing the Measurement Earth blockchain-based big data platform has been launched to the Telos MAINNET and published to the main website at [https://www.measurement.earth](https://www.measurement.earth). Unrestricted access to 24-hour charts for Air quality monitoring stations featuring Sensirion SPS30 particulate matter sensors. Like the data platform, the web portal is also distributed and decentralized - through IPFS. Access the to the web platform is possible through any IPFS gateway such as https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTmXmEiySBkMrhqtzJgaZYSr7W8M3kumpqNcazkKcSaum
- `02/06/2021` IT'S COMING.
- `06/25/2020` EOSIoT has morphed into Measurement Earth: a global open data and trusted sensor platform. The pre-launch website is now up on IPFS: [https://www.measurement.earth](https://www.measurement.earth).  We have also updated the EOSIO IoT node simulation and stress test software and dApp to work with Telos which we are considering deploying the Measurement Earth dApp to.
- `12/31/2019` We've relaunched the RFID Demo dApp on the Jungle 2.0 Testnet and have correspondingly updated the RFID scanner software for the Raspberry pi and the rfid-html webpage.  All is well again.  We'll relaunch on the mainnet when the CPU crunch issue has been resolved.
- Our RFID scanner for Raspberry Pi has the **rfid-html** website re-hosted directly from GitHub at [eosiot.github.io/rfid-html](https://eosiot.github.io/rfid-html/)
