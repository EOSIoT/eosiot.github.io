### News

- `12/31/2019` We've relaunched the RFID Demo dApp on the Jungle 2.0 Testnet and have correspondingly updated the RFID scanner software for the Raspberry pi and the rfid-html webpage.  All is well again.  We'll relaunch on the mainnet when the CPU crunch issue has been resolved.
- Our RFID scanner for Raspberry Pi has the **rfid-html** website re-hosted directly from GitHub at [eosiot.github.io/rfid-html](https://eosiot.github.io/rfid-html/)
